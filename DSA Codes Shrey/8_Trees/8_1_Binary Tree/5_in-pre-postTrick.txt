1) Preorder traversal :- (Root left right)
   first draw lines to the left side of every node
   start from root node and take the pickup points

2) Postorder traversal :- (left right root)
   First draw lines to the right side of every node
   start from root node but ensure that root node will always remains at the last

3) Inorder traversal :- (left root right)
   First draw lines to the bottom side of every node
   start traversing from root node but ensure that the bottom left node will always remain first
